# Make sure that the file is a valid input for TSL Generator. You can ensure this by executing:
#
# ./Binaries/TSLgenerator-mac fbpost.txt
# ./Binaries/TSLgenerator-linux fbpost.txt
# Binaries/TSLgenerator-win8.exe fbpost.txt
#
# The correct execution of TSL Generator should produce the resulting file fbpost.txt.tsl. You must include this file in your submission in this same directory.
